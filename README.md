## Roulette Simulation 

following the guidance and design principles outlined in the book [Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design](https://buildingskills.itmaybeahack.com/oodesign.html) ***(Python Version)***


### Dependencies

* [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3.6/) *(code should also work for Python 2.7)*
* [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/)


### Notes

The project is meant as an introduction to Oblect Oriented Design in Python. Its audience is programmers already familiar with Python, who have completed an introductory tutorial in O.O.P, and wish to implement its principles in a slightly larger 'real-life' scenario, of intermediate complexity & difficulty. 

The project follows an iterative process, where features are added incrementally. It is also a good project for anyone wishing to try out Test-Driven Development (TDD), starting with writing tests classes/methods, and building code that passes these.

The book's author, [Steven F. Lott](http://slott-softwarearchitect.blogspot.com/), has been explicit in not providing code for the book, as its purpose is to teach OOP principles by coding ; hence, the containing code should only be viewed by prospective readers after they have themselves written their version (for comparison's sake) and not as a reference guide.
